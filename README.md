A command-line application designed to facilitate structured expense tracking and monthly budgeting for individual users.
Technologies Used: Python, CSV File Handling, datetime, calendar modules, Object-Oriented Programming

This project involves the development of a command-line based budget management tool that enables users to efficiently record and monitor their daily expenditures. It supports the categorization of expenses, tracks them over time, and provides monthly summaries to assist in financial planning and analysis. The system utilizes persistent storage through CSV files to retain user data without the need for a database, ensuring both simplicity and accessibility.

Pythonâ€™s standard libraries, including datetime and calendar, are employed to automate time-based operations, while object-oriented principles structure the application into reusable and maintainable components. Key functionalities include input validation, date-specific logging, and the generation of organized expense reports.

This project demonstrates a solid grasp of backend logic, data management, and software design principles. It reflects an ability to develop functional, user-oriented solutions that address practical, real-world financial needs. Potential future enhancements include the integration of data visualization tools and a graphical user interface to improve usability and insight generation.
